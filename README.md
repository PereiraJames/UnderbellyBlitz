# UnderBellyBlitzCardGame README
Personal Project Card Game

## Introduction:
This my Unity/C# developed game using the Mirror Network Framework. It is a typical Trading Card Game similar to Hearthstone or Magic The Gathering.

The main structure of the game is deployed but improvements and additional features are still being added.

## Installation:

Install Game - {}

Run the "CardGame.exe" file.

Due it has only been set-up as a local host multiplayer game, you will need to open two windows of the game to play. Essentially playing both sides of the game.
Implementation of online multiplayer in the works.

## How To Play:
Each Player will connect to the same Server. Meaning one player will need to Host, whilst the second joins them.

Once both have joined the same Server.

They will be prompted to choose a deck of cards. Each deck has its own play style. e.g(Jackelbell focussing on summoning alot of minions and dealing alot of small damage on a frequent basis).

Once both have confirmed their decks. The actual game begins.

Objective of the Game: Bring your opponent to 0 HP or have the most Doubloons once the Community Doubloons have run out.

Each player has a hand limit of 8 cards and are only allowed to have 8 cards in play/ on the board.
